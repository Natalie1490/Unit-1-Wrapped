/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which we idenitify what a user needs from the product";
const design = "This is the third step, in which we outline the details";
const implementation = "This is the fouth step, in which we take action and start acting on the plan";
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which we test to see if there are any defects";
const maintain = "This is the last step, in which we ensure that everything is running smoothly and continue to monitore the software";
